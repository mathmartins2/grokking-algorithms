# Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People

This repository contains implementations of algorithms mentioned in the book "Grokking Algorithms". It is recommended to run these algorithms using the `bun` package.

## Installation

To install `bun`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Running the Algorithms

After installing `bun`, you can execute the algorithms using the following commands:

- **Binary Search Algorithm**

  ```bash
  bun alg/binary-search.ts
  ```

- **Simple Search Algorithm**

  ```bash
  bun alg/simple-search.ts
  ```

- **QuickSort Algorithm**
  ```bash
  bun alg/quicksort.ts
  ```

These commands are specified in the `scripts` section of the package, allowing for easy execution of the algorithms.
